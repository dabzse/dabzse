![MR. Mihaly NYilas](dabzse.svg)

at first about my name:

why is there "MR."?

    it shows you: I'm not a lady / girl / woman

my first name is originally Mihály (but I don't really like it...)

    it confuses a non Hungarians, because of the letter "á"

    so I made it easier to "understand", read, write, remember.

    it is translatable to English, and it means: Michael (yes, like the ArchAngel)

my surname / last name is Nyilas. then why "NYilas"?

    N followed by Y is a combined letter with a one-letter meaning

    my surname / last name is also translatable to English, it means:

    Archer, Sagittarius, Bowman

## something more

the only digital way is **Linux**! don't forget it... I found my favo[u]rite one, using it continuously since 2013(?)

Fedora loves Python. me too, and PHP, and ...

if you have any questions, feel free to contact me.

I think you are smart enough to "find" my e-mail address, it's not hidden...

I think this is enough for now.
